# ANZ Bank - Google Next Demo 2023

This is an example repository that demonstrates how to use GitOps to create GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) clusters on demand, register them to a Fleet, and bootstrap them with FluxCD.

Once the newly created Fleet clusters are bootstrapped with FluxCD, they will automatically begin to synchronize all GKE cluster platform configurations and application tenant configurations.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Before you begin, check that all GCP project references are updated in the repository to your corrosponding GCP project ID.

Additionally, worth noting that once you have completed the following steps the `GITHUB_TOKEN` will be stored in a SOPS encrypted kubernetes [secret](./kubernetes/namespaces/base/flux-system/addons/notifications/github/secret.enc.yaml).

1. Fork and clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<user/org>/anz-next-demo-23.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory and run the setup script

```bash
export PROJECT_ID=<YOUR PROJECT ID>
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<YOUR GITHUB TOKEN>
export GITHUB_USER=<YOUR GITHUB USER>

cd anz-next-demo-23
./hack/bootstrap.sh
```

**Note:** *Change the exported variables to the appropriate values; Additional values can be adapted in the [bootstrap.sh](./hack/bootstrap.sh) script.*

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up your GKE cluster
